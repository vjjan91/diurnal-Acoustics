# Vocal activity

In this script, we examine differences in vocal activity between dawn and dusk for each species. 

## Install necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(rstatix)
```

## Load acoustic data and species scientific names data
```{r}
acoustic_data <- read.csv("results/acoustic_data.csv")
species_codes <- read.csv("data/species-annotation-codes.csv")
```

## Filtering acoustic data to ensure sampling periods are even across dawn and dusk  

Since our recording schedule was uneven (6am to 10am in the morning and 4pm to 7pm in the evening), we filter acoustic data to retain recordings between 6am and 830am and recordings made between 4pm and 630pm so that the two sampling windows capture a similar amount of time right after dawn and right before dusk. 

```{r}
dawn <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day == "dawn") %>%
  filter(start_time >= 060000 & start_time <= 083000)

dusk <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day == "dusk") %>%
  filter(start_time >= 160000 & start_time <= 183000)

acoustic_data <- bind_rows(dawn[, -10], dusk[, -10])
```


## Vocal activity across time periods

A number of factors need to be considered in further analysis: accounting for time_of_day, observed_identity for example. However, we run analyses that account for differences in calling activity by species for dawn and dusk.

```{r}
# sampling effort by time_of_day
effort <- acoustic_data %>%
  dplyr::select(site_id, date, time_of_day) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(time_of_day) %>%
  count(time_of_day) %>%
  rename(., nVisits = n)

# Above, we note that we had sampled ~145 site-date combinations at dawn, while ~230 site-date combinations were sampled at dusk

# total number of acoustic detections summarized across every 10-s audio file
# here, we estimate % detections at dawn and dusk, while accounting for sampling effort
vocal_act <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day, eBird_codes) %>%
  summarise(detections = sum(number)) %>%
  left_join(., species_codes[, c(1, 2, 5)],
    by = "eBird_codes"
  ) %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  mutate(total_detections = sum(detections)) %>%
  mutate(percent_detections = (detections / total_detections) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

## accouting for sampling effort and normalizing data
vocal_act <- vocal_act %>%
  left_join(., effort, by = "time_of_day") %>%
  mutate(normalized_detections = detections / nVisits) %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  mutate(total_normalized_detections = sum(normalized_detections)) %>%
  mutate(percent_normalized_detections = (normalized_detections / total_normalized_detections) * 100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # in our case, we have 4 species which have 100% detections in dawn, Indian blackbird, Little spiderhunter, Oriental-Magpie Robin and Purple sunbird. For these, we add a additional row specifying no detections in dusk.

Here, we see whether there are differences in the acoustic detections for each species between dawn and dusk.
