We will load annotation datasets for both dawn and dusk and process them further to ensure that we can quickly extract measures of vocal activity in future scripts. For the sake of future analysis, we define dawn as periods of acoustic data annotated between 6am and 10am. We define dusk as periods of acoustic data annotated between 4pm to 7pm (Please note that in future scripts, we subsample the data to ensure that uniform sampling periods are being compared across dawn and dusk). # These dawn and dusk annotation .csvs are not uploaded to GitHub and can be provided upon request # Please write to Vijay Ramesh if you would like to access the raw data - vr292@cornell.edu) # However, all outputs emerging from this script, which includes processed annotations are public and can be used for analysis # dawn data summer_dawn &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/summer-dawn-annotations.csv&quot;) winter_dawn &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/winter-dawn-annotations.csv&quot;) dawn &lt;- bind_rows(summer_dawn, winter_dawn) names(dawn) # reorder columns to ensure the species codes appear one after another dawn &lt;- dawn %&gt;% relocate(c(&quot;BFOW&quot;, &quot;SBEO&quot;, &quot;JUNI&quot;, &quot;ASKO&quot;, &quot;HSWO&quot;), .after = &quot;CORO&quot;) # split the filename column into 4 columns : site, date, time and splits dawn &lt;- separate(dawn, col = Filename, into = c(&quot;site_id&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;splits&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-(Birds:Notes)) %&gt;% # remove columns not required &amp; rename rename(., restoration_type = Restoration.Type..Benchmark.Active.Passive.) %&gt;% rename(., time_of_day = Time..Morning.Evening.Night.) %&gt;% mutate(time_of_day = &quot;dawn&quot;) # dusk data summer_dusk &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/summer-dusk-annotations.csv&quot;) winter_dusk &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/winter-dusk-annotations.csv&quot;) dusk &lt;- bind_rows(summer_dusk, winter_dusk) names(dusk) # reorder columns to ensure the species codes appear one after another dusk &lt;- dusk %&gt;% relocate(&quot;GREN&quot;, .after = &quot;CORO&quot;) # split the filename column into 4 columns : site, date, time and splits dusk &lt;- separate(dusk, col = Filename, into = c(&quot;site_id&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;splits&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-(Birds:Notes)) %&gt;% # remove columns not required &amp; rename rename(., restoration_type = Restoration.Type..Benchmark.Active.Passive.) %&gt;% rename(., time_of_day = Time..Morning.Evening.Night.) %&gt;% mutate(time_of_day = &quot;dusk&quot;) # create a single dataframe acoustic_data &lt;- bind_rows(dawn, dusk) 2.3 Add standardized eBird species codes for future analysis species_codes &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/species-annotation-codes.csv&quot;) ## Using the splice operator from an example on stackOverflow ## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60113369/change-column-names-in-dataframe-based-on-matching-to-another-dataframe-by-dplyr eBirdCodes &lt;- species_codes %&gt;% dplyr::select(eBird_codes, species_annotation_codes) %&gt;% deframe() # replace current annotation codes with eBird codes acoustic_data &lt;- acoustic_data %&gt;% rename(!!!eBirdCodes) 2.4 How much data has been annotated for dawn and dusk across sites and days?

Highly territorial species are those which defend and maintain their territories throughout the year. Weakly territorial species are those which have broadly overlapping home ranges, or sometimes join mixed flocks without defined spatial ranges. Non-territorial species are those which do not defend territories, or defend very small areas around nest sites, or defend song or display posts only. 7.1 Loading necessary libraries library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(vegan) library(ggplot2) library(scico) library(data.table) library(extrafont) library(ggstatsplot) library(purrr) library(ggpubr) library(ggrepel) library(ggdist) library(gghalves) library(rstatix) 7.2 Loading territoriality data territoriality &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/territoriality-data.csv&quot;) territoriality &lt;- territoriality %&gt;% dplyr::select(Species, Territory) colnames(territoriality) &lt;- c(&quot;scientific_name&quot;, &quot;territory&quot;) # Updating the scientific names of following species as per our dataset: # Flame-throated bulbul- Rubigula gularis (earlier Pycnonotus gularis) # Black eagle- Ictinaetus malaiensis (earlier Ictinaetus malayensis) # Brown-capped pygmy woodpecker- Yungipicus nanus (earlier Dendrocopos nanus) # Malabar barbet- Psilopogon malabaricus (earlier Megalaima malabarica) # Dark-fronted babbler- Dumetia atriceps (earlier Rhopocichla atriceps) # Greater flameback- Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus (earlier Chrysocolaptes lucidus) # Indian blue robin- Larvivora brunnea (earlier Luscinia brunnea) # Indian yellow tit- Machlolophus aplonotus (earlier Parus aplonotus) # Jungle babbler- Argya striata (earlier Turdoides striata) # Orange-headed thrush- Geokichla citrina (earlier Zoothera citrina) # Rufous babbler- Argya subrufa (earlier Turdoides subrufa) # Rufous woodpecker- Micropternus brachyurus (earlier Celeus brachyurus) # Rusty-tailed flycatcher- Ficedula ruficauda (earlier Muscicapa ruficauda # Spot-bellied eagle owl- Ketupa nipalensis (earlier Bubo nipalensis) # Spotted dove- Spilopelia chinensis (earlier Stigmatopelia chinensis) # Thick-billed warbler- Arundinax aedon (earlier Acrocephalus aedon) # White-bellied flycatcher- Cyornis pallidipes (earlier Cyornis pallipes) # White-cheeked barbet- Psilopogon viridis (earlier Megalaima viridis) # Wayanad laughingthrush- Pterorhinus delesserti (earlier Garrulax delesserti) # Yellow-browed bulbul- Iole indica (earlier Acritillas indica) territoriality &lt;- territoriality %&gt;% mutate(scientific_name = recode(scientific_name, &quot;Pycnonotus gularis&quot; = &quot;Rubigula gularis&quot;, &quot;Ictinaetus malayensis&quot; = &quot;Ictinaetus malaiensis&quot;, &quot;Dendrocopos nanus&quot; = &quot;Yungipicus nanus&quot;, &quot;Megalaima malabarica&quot; = &quot;Psilopogon malabaricus&quot;, &quot;Rhopocichla atriceps&quot; = &quot;Dumetia atriceps&quot;, &quot;Chrysocolaptes lucidus&quot; = &quot;Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus&quot;, &quot;Luscinia brunnea&quot; = &quot;Larvivora brunnea&quot;, &quot;Parus aplonotus&quot; = &quot;Machlolophus aplonotus&quot;, &quot;Turdoides striata&quot; = &quot;Argya striata&quot;, &quot;Zoothera citrina&quot; = &quot;Geokichla citrina&quot;, &quot;Turdoides subrufa&quot; = &quot;Argya subrufa&quot;, &quot;Celeus brachyurus&quot; = &quot;Micropternus brachyurus&quot;, &quot;Muscicapa ruficauda&quot; = &quot;Ficedula ruficauda&quot;, &quot;Bubo nipalensis&quot; = &quot;Ketupa nipalensis&quot;, &quot;Stigmatopelia chinensis&quot; = &quot;Spilopelia chinensis&quot;, &quot;Acrocephalus aedon&quot; = &quot;Arundinax aedon&quot;, &quot;Cyornis pallipes&quot; = &quot;Cyornis pallidipes&quot;, &quot;Megalaima viridis&quot; = &quot;Psilopogon viridis&quot;, &quot;Garrulax delesserti&quot; = &quot;Pterorhinus delesserti&quot;, &quot;Acritillas indica&quot; = &quot;Iole indica&quot;)) 7.3 Load acoustic data and species scientific names data acoustic_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;results/acoustic_data.csv&quot;) species_codes &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/species-annotation-codes.csv&quot;) 7.4 Filtering acoustic data to ensure sampling periods are even across dawn and dusk Since our recording schedule was uneven (6am to 10am in the morning and 4pm to 7pm in the evening), we filter acoustic data to retain recordings between 6am and 830am and recordings made between 4pm and 630pm so that the two sampling windows capture a similar amount of time right after dawn and right before dusk. dawn &lt;- acoustic_data %&gt;% group_by(time_of_day == &quot;dawn&quot;) %&gt;% filter(start_time &gt;= 060000 &amp; start_time &lt;= 083000) dusk &lt;- acoustic_data %&gt;% group_by(time_of_day == &quot;dusk&quot;) %&gt;% filter(start_time &gt;= 160000 &amp; start_time &lt;= 183000) acoustic_data &lt;- bind_rows(dawn[, -10], dusk[, -10]) 7.5 Vocal activity across time periods A number of factors need to be considered in further analysis: accounting for time_of_day, observed_identity for example.
